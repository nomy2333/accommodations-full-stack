			+card({
				show: true,
				parentId: 'accordion1',
				number: '1',
				header: 'Why should I refer to a real estate salesperson?'
			}).card-corporate
				p A real estate salesperson is more than just a “sales person.” They act on your behalf as your agent, providing you with advice and guidance and doing a job – helping you buy or sell a home. While it is true they get paid for what they do, so do other professions that provide advice, guidance.

			+card({
				parentId: 'accordion1',
				number: '2',
				header: 'Should I talk with a bank before looking at homes?'
			}).card-corporate
				p The answer to the question is YES!  There are tons of reasons why you should talk with a bank and get pre-approved before looking at homes.  First and foremost, talking with a bank before looking at homes can help you understand exactly how much you can afford.  There is no reason to look at homes that are listed for $250,000 if you can only afford up to $200,000.

				parentId: 'accordion1',
				number: '3',
				header: 'Should I buy or continue to rent?'
			}).card-corporate
				p Buying a home can be a very solid investment.  This being said, renting can also be a better option for some, depending on the circumstances.  The current interest rates are incredible.  A 30-year FHA mortgage can be locked in at a rate of around 3.5%.  Since the interest rates are so low, it actually can be cheaper to pay a mortgage right now than paying rent.

			+card({
				parentId: 'accordion1',
				number: '4',
				header: 'Can I find a rent-to-own property?'
			}).card-corporate
				p Of course you can, but the probability isn’t very high.  The same can be said about a rent-to-own property.  A common question from home buyers is whether rent-to-owns exist or whether an owner would consider that option.  They are out there, but there are somethings that you need to know before agreeing to a rent-to-own.
